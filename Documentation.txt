Project 2

Shinkicker Multiplayer is a multiplayer game where players compete to kick eachother's shins to come out on top
as the one who hasn't been kicked in the shins. It's based on a game I developed independently as a 2D platformer
changing the previous focus from the platforming to more of a hectic brawl between a multitude of players trying
to scramble around and kick eachother in the shins.

The websockets are used to create a game that tests collisions and handles all the player movements and interactions
on the server's side.

As for what went right and what went wrong, for the most part the game seems to run smoothly (and it actually works
this time, fingers crossed) and the movement and kicking is as intended. However I would have liked to introduce
a system to manage rooms. For example, when you start off you are on a screen that lets you put in the name of
the room you wish to join and the server connects to that room. I also would have liked to have platforms in the
game for the players to jump on to add that extra element of movement to the game. And overall I wish I could
have spent more time polishing the game in general.

As I mentioned before, if I were to continue I would add a room system to the game allowing players to create
and connect to specific rooms, and I would also add those platforms to change the dynamic of the game just
a bit.

Personally, I believe that for the above and beyond I created an experience that shines in its simplicity.
The simple art and animations have a charm to them and boil down the visuals making them relatively easy
to follow. It's not bogged down by excessive detail and instead tries to create an experience that is
simple but inherently enjoyable (or at least I hope it is).
